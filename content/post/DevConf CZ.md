# DevConf CZ

I attended DevConf CZ 2020 from 24 January to 27 January. This was my first time attending DevConf CZ. I attended DevConf in order to give a talk on the "Generating SECCOMP profiles using eBPF". I worked on this project during Google Summer of Code, with my mentors Valentin Rothberg and Daniel Walsh, under the Fedora organisation. 

Attending DevConf was a great opportunity to meet developers from around the world and share ideas and knowledge. I met really fun and smart people there.

Even though I broke my phone and fell ill for certain period of the conference, I had a great time and learned a lot.

## Generating SECCOMP profiles for containers using  eBPF

This was one of the main reasons for me to attend DevConf CZ, I wanted to share with the community of the inner working of the tool we built to improve safety measures for containers.

This was one of the first time I was speaking at such a big stage and one of my first talk. Thankfully I had my mentors by my side, which helped me give the talk the best I could!

Giving this talked helped me to improve on my speaking skills, and ability to explain things. Although I still have a lot of things to learn, and improve!

Here are some of the talks I found a great deal to learn from.

- *State of Container Security*
    - By Dan  Walsh which detailed the various security measures currently present in containers and further technologies being developed. Dan is a great speaker, who makes attending his talks fun and interactive, and a must to. The talk also touched upon what I was going to be talking about, and also served as a great advertisement to my talk!
- *Understanding Container engine by Demo*
    - By Scott McCarty, this talk peeked inside the how a container engine worked and made us look at all the moving parts inside a container engine like podman.
- *Tracing Podman Run*
    - By Matt Heon, this talk was about peeking inside podman and looking at what happens when you run `podman run` it was in some ways an extension to Understanding Container engines, but it looked much deeper at the inner working of the command.
- *Psychological safety and the high performing teams*
    - By Leslie Hawthorn, talked about maintaining the right environment in an organisation and teams to make the organisation more inclusive which would foster employee well-being, creativity and innovation.
- *Brave new world of cgroups heirarchy*
    - By Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek and Michal Sekletár , I was fascinated with cgroups v2 and it's advantages over cgroups v1. And was further interested as BPF programs could be attached to cgroups v2. This talk went through the details of the new API and it's advantages.
